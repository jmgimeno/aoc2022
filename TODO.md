# TODOs

## Day 1

- create a ZPipeline to transform the String stream to the sums stream

## Day 7

- use an immutable FileSystem implemented as a Zipper
- then use a ZRef to hold a mutable reference to it

## Day 11

- use a single map for everything and use optics for access/update

## Day 12

- implement a min-heap that allows to change priority to use in A*

## Day 13

- use zio-parse

## Day 14

- the idea of filtering out the segments outside the event horizon seems to not work
- maybe the idea is to find a recurrence between the lines in the final configuration
